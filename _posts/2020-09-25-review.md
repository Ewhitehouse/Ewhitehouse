After the renovation of the Duke Chapel in 2016, 14 faculty members, staff, and students took on a project that aimed to preserve cultural heritage. 
The project director, Ed Triplett, gathered this group together to create an outstanding image. 
The group was there to document the Chapel’s newly restored interior. The process was very tedious and they put in long hours to pull it off. 
The students and staff  took more than 1400 photographs to create this powerful project. 
The 3D Duke Chapel project began as a workshop to train graduate students in Art, Art History, and Visual Studies. 
But, it also became something for many Duke students and tourists to enjoy.
 
For the project, they used Photogrammetry. This is a method of 3D scanning that uses overlapping photographs taken from many different angles. 
All these photographs assemble a 3D model of a chosen architectural space or object. 
Photogrammetry uses two-dimensional photographs to virtually reconstruct our three-dimensional world. 
Ed Triplett calls this “the reversal of photography.” 
He means that usually we photograph our 3D world on a two dimensional canvas, but photogrammetry does the opposite. 
These images needed to have uniformity in light, exposure, and composition, so that pattern-recognition software has consistent details to reference as it constructs a three dimensional model.
 
It took a while to gather all the pictures because they needed to collect systematic and clean data. 
Once the 1400 pictures were taken, they were then processed to create a “point cloud” of 84 million colored 3D points. 
This project is accomplished with the Wired! Lab and Research Computing center at Duke University. 
Before, this process would have been time consuming and labor-intensive. 
But now, the algorithms and graphics processors are spiking in power and photogrammetry is becoming easier and quicker to do.
 
The audience for this project is anyone who wants to better understand the structure of  gothic cathedrals. 
Duke University also wanted to have all the data and a rough draft of the inside of the chapel in case the molding started to deteriorate and they needed to make a repair. 
This three dimensional picture will show exactly what each piece of stone looks like to help them make repairs.
 
When reading about this project, I found it to be very interesting but lacked a lot of detail. 
Ed Triplett has used photogrammetry several times so it would have been interesting to read more details about the process. 
This project is impressive and I would have liked to have read even more, but was only given a handful of details. 
Given more of a step by step process of what they did in the computing center, would have been very helpful. 
This project is something that I have never came across before and I am impressed with Ed Triplett’s knowledge and ability to pull this off. 
Duke University now has a complex 3D image of their chapel to show students and guests who arrive on campus. 
This project was a great way to capture history.
