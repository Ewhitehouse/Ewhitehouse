My project is based on social media. 
I wanted to create a timeline for users to learn more about when social media platforms were created as well as details of what updates and improvements have been made. 
My research has been going great and I’ve been learning a lot about social media platforms. 
The reason why I wanted to research this topic is because social media plays a large role in our world today and I am very active on social media. 
I love posting images and keeping my followers up to date one what I am doing especially on Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and TikTok. 
This project has allowed me to learn when each platform was created as well as when they each gained 1 million users. 
I wanted to create a timeline that was interactive and let users click on icons and view new information. 
I want users to see the year that platforms were created as well as when milestones were achieved. Not many timelines that I have viewed, have been interactive. 
Usually, they are just images of when platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram were developed, and that is it. 
I want to create a timeline with much more information. 
I will have icons that when clicked on, will be directed to other links.
The Digital Information World website published a timeline of social media from 2002-2018. 
This timeline includes when apps such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest were launched for the public use. 
It has dates when new logos came out and when different versions of the apps were created. 
This timeline is very simple and doesn’t allow you to click on anything. 
It has small logos and short captions that don’t really tell you anything about the platform. 
This timeline is also outdated as so much has changed since 2018. 
Apps like TikTok and Pinterest are just two platforms that were greatly impacted due to COVID-19. 
Since quarantine in March, these two apps have been a prime example of more downloads and more use. 
I came across a social media timeline on the Infoplease website. 
It had really interesting details such as when a platform reached a million members, which platforms buy other platforms, and which countries these social media platforms are available in. 
But, this timeline has no images and isn’t interactive and doesn’t direct you to other websites. 
The timeline I want to create, will have large, eye-catching photos and icons with dates that stand out. 
None of the social media timelines that I have seen are interactive, and that is the main thing I want to accomplish. 
I want this to be something that is fun for people to use as well as teach them something they might never have known. 
This timeline is especially relevant today because social media plays a huge role in everyday life. 
Social media plays a large role in my life as I spend hours on it a day. 
This project has allowed me to learn more about certain platforms and definitely expanded my horizon!
