# Hey! I'm Erica Whitehouse . . .

. . . in positive and negative ways. Due to the virus, students at my school were sent home in the spring and sports were cancelled for the fall. 
This has caused me to miss out on two seasons that I could have spent with my team. 
On the up side, this gives me extra years of eligibility to play at a graduate school and make more memories and meet new people!

I was able to spend a lot of time with my family this summer which meant the absolute world to me. 
I grew a lot closer to my younger sister and we have built a bond that wouldn’t have been possible without the virus. 
I also got to spend more time with my Australian Shepherd! 
I definitely grew as a person during our quarantine period as there was a lot of time for self reflection and thought. 

I spend a lot of my time on [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/ewhitehousee/boards/) creating mood boards because I am so excited for the future. 
I’m ready for COVID-19 to be gone so I can live the life I want and be able to travel and explore while I’m still young. 
The beach is my happy place (as you can see in my profile picture) and I am hopeful that I will be living on one in the near future!
