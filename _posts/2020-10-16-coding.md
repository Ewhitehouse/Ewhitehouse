I was assigned column 1 on page 651 of Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s “The Yellow Wall-Paper.” 
The purpose of this project was to code my section of the text with Oxygen XML. 
Oxygen is an editing platform that offers several features for editing documents. 
Because I am taking a computer programming class at CNU, I am already spending a lot of time with code and editing. 
Although I had never used Oxygen before this assignment, I was already feeling comfortable with what I was about to face. 


First, we used Google Docs to mark up our assigned column and get comfortable with our text. 
I use Google Docs for almost everything I do so I was very familiar with how it works. 
Google Docs is very reliable and easy to use! 
I began to dig through my Doc and was trying to find anything that stood out, such as dashes, italicized words, or quotation marks. 
Not much stood out as I noticed that I didn’t have much to annotate. 
I was wondering if my classmates had more or less to annotate than I did. 
I highlighted the most important parts that I would need to include in Oxygen.

After feeling satisfied with my annotations, I headed over to Oxygen to code my section. 
Since my section of “The Yellow Wall-Paper” was not that complicated, it was easy to code. 
It took a while but was overall pretty simple. 
I had three dashes, one quotation, and one italicized statement. 
I quickly got the hang of it and learned that ‘&#8212’ is what Oxygen associates a dash with. 
I inserted a few of those in my code where needed. 
Making sure I had the 'p' symbol before and after each sentence was tedious but was the only way to make the whole thing come together. 


I had a section of asterisks in my paper that I wasn’t sure what to do about. 
Dr. Stover explained that I can just simply type them in how I see them. 
I had a few red lines pop up near the top of the code and began to panic. 
I was wondering if these red lines would be the reason that all of my hard work would go to waste. 
But, Dr. Stover reassured me that it was a few minor fixes. 
The instructions on our course site looked a bit confusing so I was glad we were able to go step by step in class and ask questions as we went. 
It also seemed like I wasn’t the only one with questions!


Overall, I didn’t have much trouble with this assignment or using Oxygen. 
I actually enjoyed getting to play around with the code and learning more about it. 
Dr. Stover is really knowledgeable when it comes to the TEI project and she was willing to help wherever needed. 
I think once you first learn how to use the code, it is pretty easy and you can use a lot of the same techniques over and over. 
I really enjoyed this project and would be all for using Oxygen again!
