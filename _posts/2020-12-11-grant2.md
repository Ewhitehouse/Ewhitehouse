# Grant #2 Post . . .

Since my last blog post, my project has really grown. 
I established a better understanding of what it is that I really wanted to create. 
I signed up for a free account with Timeline JS and was able to create a mock up of what my final project would look like. 
I have included images of that below.

In the first image, I have the date when instagram was released to the public as well as an image of the logo and a caption.

In the second image, I have the date snapchat was released, an image, and caption as well. 
When the project is completed, users would be able to click along the timeline up until 2020. 
They would be able to learn when social media platforms were released, when important updates happened, and other fun facts such as when the most liked instagram picture was posted. 
Creating this mock up timeline with Timeline JS got me really excited for this project as I was able to see it come to life. 
It was no longer just ideas on paper, it is finally real and I can envision it. 
I’m so glad I stumbled across Timeline JS as I think it is the best program for my project. 
I’m really happy with the topic I chose as it is something that I am very interested in and passionate about. 
I believe that this topic is what made writing the grant so much fun and easy. 
I also believe that my topic is very relevant to today. 
Social media plays such a large role in our world today, but how much do people really know about it? 
That is why I wanted to create this project. 

The process of writing a grant has been very interesting and like nothing I have ever done before. 
Although there are several documents that I have had to write, they have all helped me get a better understanding of my project. 
The environmental scan helped me figure out how I want my project to stand up compared to others. 
It gave me the chance to see how I can make my project include certain aspects that others lack. 
What I mean by this, is that making my timeline interactive was the missing piece that other projects didn’t have. 
I want users to be able to click around and really enjoy the timeline as well as expand their knowledge on social media. 
Writing my grant narrative allowed me to get all of my thoughts on paper and expand on my idea. 
It was really helpful to explain to a reader why my project is worthwhile. 

Overall, I have learned a lot about my topic and a lot about what it takes to create a successful project. 
Writing this grant has been really fun and even though I won’t actually be creating the final product, I now know what it takes! 
And lastly, I have included a screenshot of one of my tweets from this week!
