title: Hey! I'm Erica Whitehouse...
---

… and I am a senior at ![Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/) from Mechanicsville, Virginia. 
I am on the ![Women’s Golf](https://www.cnusports.com/sports/womens-golf) team here at CNU so I spend most of my time on the golf course. 
I am the team captain and have been to the Division 3 National Championship where I placed 9th in the country. 
Golf means a lot to me but so does my education! 

I am majoring in political science but don’t currently know what I want to do with my degree.
I don’t have the attention span for law school so I might consider real estate or something that allows me to be my own boss! 

My main focus right now is graduating from CNU in May of 2021 and finding a new place to call home. 
I would love to go to graduate school in either ![Hawaii](https://www.hawaii.edu/) or ![California].(https://www.ucla.edu/) 
Since I come from a small town in Virginia, this would be a big step out of my comfort zone that I am willing to take.
